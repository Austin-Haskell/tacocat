This has the code, slides, and some notes from the August Haskell Beginner meetups.

You can view the slides as a pdf, but I included the original markdown and a makefile to build the slides if you prefer. You need pandoc installed to build them.

The code is annotated to some extent, as we went through many alternatives and I wanted to preserve those for people who either a) weren't there or b) would like to refresh their memories.

I also added a file to capture the awesome generalized rules about indentation that we talked about. If anyone has more details and/or corrections to add, please do not hesitate to send a pull request.

We'll start working with recursion, lists, and folds in September, and I will probably do a new repo for each project if that seems reasonable.

Cheers, y'all. Julie
